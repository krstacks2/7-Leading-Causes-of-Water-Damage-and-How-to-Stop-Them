                <h2>What Causes Water Damage?</h2>
                <p>
                    Water damage isn’t just inconvenient—it can quickly turn into a homeowner’s worst nightmare. One day, you’re enjoying your cozy San Antonio home, and the next, you’re ankle-deep in water, frantically trying to save your belongings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Complete Flood Restoration, we’ve seen it all—from slow, leaky pipes to full-blown floods that make you feel like you need a canoe to get around your living room. The good news? Most water damage is preventable if you know what to look for and how to address the causes before they spiral out of control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re here to break down the top seven causes of water damage and, more importantly, show you how to stop them in their tracks. Let’s dive in (pun intended).

                <h2>1. Leaky Pipes: The Ticking Time Bomb in Your Walls</h2>
                <p>
                    Ever heard that faint dripping noise at night and told yourself, “It’s probably nothing”? Well, it might not be nothing. Leaky pipes are a leading cause of water damage, and they can escalate from a minor annoyance to a major issue faster than you think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pipes can corrode, crack, or burst due to age, high water pressure, or even extreme Texas heat causing expansion and contraction. What starts as a small drip can damage walls, ceilings, and floors before you even realize it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How to Stop It:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check under sinks and around exposed pipes regularly.</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to signs like discolored walls or a sudden spike in your water bill.</li>
                    <li>If you spot a leak, call us immediately. The sooner we fix it, the less damage you’ll face.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>2. Clogged Gutters: When Your Home’s Raincoat Fails</h2>
                <p>
                    Your gutters are like your home’s raincoat, directing water away from the roof and foundation. But when they’re clogged with leaves, dirt, and debris, they can’t do their job. Water overflows, seeps into your walls or foundation, and leaves you with a soggy mess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In San Antonio, where we experience everything from scorching dry spells to sudden storms, clogged gutters are a recipe for disaster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How to Stop It:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean your gutters at least twice a year, especially after the fall season.</li>
                    <li>Consider installing gutter guards to keep debris out.</li>
                    <li>Check for pooling water around your foundation after heavy rain—it could mean your gutters aren’t draining properly.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>3. Faulty Appliances: Your Home’s Silent Water Damage Culprit</h2>
                <p>
                    We love our appliances—until they decide to betray us. Washing machines, dishwashers, and water heaters are some of the biggest culprits when it comes to water damage. A tiny hose crack or a loose connection can cause water to pool where it shouldn’t.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One time, we helped a homeowner who thought their washing machine was “just making funny noises.” Turns out, the hoses had been leaking for months, and the water had ruined the subfloor. Don’t let this happen to you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How to Stop It:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace old hoses every 3–5 years, especially for washing machines.</li>
                    <li>Check for damp spots or rust around your appliances.</li>
                    <li>Turn off water supply lines to appliances when you’re going out of town—trust us, you don’t want to come home to a flooded laundry room.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>4. Poor Drainage: The Hidden Threat Beneath Your Feet</h2>
                <p>
                    Poor drainage around your home’s foundation is like inviting water to come inside. When water doesn’t flow away from your property, it pools around your foundation and can eventually seep into your basement or crawlspace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    San Antonio’s clay-heavy soil doesn’t help matters—it holds onto water, putting even more pressure on your home’s foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How to Stop It:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure your yard slopes away from your house.</li>
                    <li>Install drainage systems like French drains or downspout extensions.</li>
                    <li>Check for cracks in your foundation and seal them before water finds its way in.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>5. HVAC System Issues: When Comfort Comes at a Cost</h2>
                <p>
                    Your air conditioner works hard to keep you cool during those sweltering San Antonio summers, but it can also cause water damage if it’s not maintained properly. Condensation can build up in the unit or its drainage line, and if that water has nowhere to go, it can start pooling in places you don’t want it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How to Stop It:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Schedule regular HVAC maintenance to keep your system in top shape.</li>
                    <li>Make sure your AC’s condensate line is clean and draining properly.</li>
                    <li>Look for water stains around your AC unit—it’s a sign something’s not right.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>6. Roof Damage: When a Minor Leak Becomes a Major Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Your roof is your home’s first line of defense against the elements, but it can’t do its job if it’s damaged. Missing shingles, cracked flashing, or general wear and tear can let water sneak in during a rainstorm.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In a city like San Antonio, where sudden downpours are common, a water leak can lead to roof damage faster than you can grab a bucket.

                    <b>How to Stop It:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspect your roof twice a year and after major storms.</li>
                    <li>Look for missing shingles, sagging areas, or debris buildup.</li>
                    <li>If you spot anything suspicious, call a professional (that’s us!) to assess the damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>7. Natural Disasters: When Mother Nature Comes Knocking</h2>
                <p>
                    Texas weather is nothing if not unpredictable. From flash floods to hurricanes, natural disasters are a major cause of water damage. Even if you’re not in a high-risk flood zone, heavy rains can overwhelm drainage systems and cause water to invade your home.
                </p>

                    <b>How to Stop It:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seal cracks in your foundation and walls to keep water out.</li>
                    <li>Elevate valuable items in your basement or lower levels.</li>
                    <li>Invest in flood barriers and consider flood insurance—it’s better to be safe than sorry.</li>
                </ul>
